# Ninja Project

Package for a comfortable work with C/C++ projects, generating Ninja files.

## Features:

  * Proper source code completion, using Compilation Database and Clang
  * Multiple build paths (Debug, Release, ...)

Many more features are planned - to make an Atom Editor a "full-metal" C++ IDE:

  * Real-time compilation and in-place diagnostics with help of PCH
  * Code navigation, like go-to-declaration, find-usages, etc.
  * Refactoring support
